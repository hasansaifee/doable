Currently following [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-native-firebase-tutorial/) to set up simple login/register and data push/get with Firebase.

Follow the steps below to get the app running:

1. Install Expo CLI by running _npm install -g expo-cli_
2. Install all the necessary packages by running _npm install_
3. To run the program, run _yarn ios_
